# AWS JPL Rover Workshop

Welcome! The exploration of space continues to occur at a rapid pace. We want you to journey to Mars and use your skills to improve how rovers on the Red Planet help unlock the secrets of the universe.

The goal of this challenge is to use machine learning to autonomously operate the virtual Open-Source Rover created by NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to explore the surface of Mars.

In this workshop you become familiar with AWS RoboMaker, a service that enables you to easily develop, simulate and deploy intelligent robot applications that integrate with AWS services. You will also learn about Amazon Sagemaker, which helps you build, train, tune and deploy Machine Learning, Deep Learning and **Reinforcement Learning** models at scale.
